Welcome to the demo theme. This is a sample About page shipped with the theme so you can see how pages render. Replace this copy with your own.

### What is this?

An Astro-powered blog theme with:

- Multilingual routing (optional)
- Tags and archive pages
- Related posts and reading time
- A11y-minded, content-focused layout

### Customize your site

- Edit site settings in `src/config.ts` and languages in `src/config.i18n.ts`.
- Add posts to `src/content/posts/` (and `src/content/<lang>/posts/` for translations).
- Tweak layouts and components in `src/components/` and `src/layouts/`.
- Update theme styles in `src/themes/` or `src/styles/global.css`.

### Writing posts

Add a Markdown file with front matter like:

```yaml
title: "My First Post"
date: 2025-01-01
description: "Optional summary shown in lists."
tags: ["getting-started", "demo"]
```

That’s it—happy publishing!
